FTFontSelector implements a clone of the font selector that can be found in
Apple’s iOS Pages application.

For now it targets the current iOS 6 look, because we won’t know what Apple’s
version in iOS 7 will look like yet.


## Usage

The one exposed class that you need to work with is `FTFontSelectorController`.
This class is a self contained `UINavigationController` subclass that provides
all the required features.

To use it on the iPhone, it’s common to add the controller instance as a child
view controller in the same place that the keyboard is normally shown. On iPad
it’s common to show the controller in a `UIPopoverController`.

See the example app in `Project` for examples on both devices. Note that the
iPhone version uses a bit of a hack by adding the view to the `UITextView`’s
`inputView`. In Pages the keyboard is actually dismissed beforehand, so keep
this in mind.


## Installation

FTFontSelector is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to
install it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "FTFontSelector"

Alternatively, add all the source files in `Classes` and the resource bundle at
`Assets/FTFontSelector.bundle` to your Xcode project and add `CoreText` to the
‘frameworks build phase’.
